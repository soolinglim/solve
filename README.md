# Code Repository for SOLVE
## PPSN submission: Evolving Through the Looking Glass: Learning Improved Search Spaces with Variational Autoencoders

### SOLVE extends the original COIL project (Constrained Optimization in Learned Latent Space) to extra criteria in addition to constraints, with layers/stacks and normalized flow VAE. Naming still reflects the original project.

### Raw research code used to perform all experiments is in the ``v0`` branch. 

#### This code is for review only, upon publication more usable/polished/documented code will be made available for use.

#### Details of code contents and structure is located in README.txt
